instalation :

1. copy to BCM directory these files :
      - bcm2fs
      - bcm2fs.imp
      - 7pfbb

2. add to crontab.bcm similiar line :
      44   * * * * bcm2fs
      
3. edit variables ( patches ) in bcm2fs and 7pfbb everything begining with
   # is remark and is ignored..


running of automatic routine bcm2fs.imp (my conf) :

1. start bcm2fs
   scan from last position (stored in /var/tmp/lastone) in check.bcm and take
   outside all 7+ (/tmp/pok/M_FILTER)

2. start 7pfbb
   take out all 7+ files (into /usr/local/fbbs/7m) and then try decode all
   files *.p01 *.7pl. if decoding was successful is logged (/var/log/bcm2fs.log)
  

i think that's all.  enjoy. all critics to my head ok2bxt@ok0pbx :-))
